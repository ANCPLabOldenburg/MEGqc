Pipeline Settings
=================

The pipeline settings are stored in the ``settings.ini`` file. 

Settings are divided into sections, each corresponding to a different pipeline step.

As the result of analysis will be produced (for each data file (.fif)):

- html report for all metrics
- csv file with the results of the analysis for some of metrics
- machine readable json file with the results of the analysis for all metrics

In the html report: 

- all the plots produced by MEQ-QC are interactive, they can be scrolled through and enlarged. 
- a few plots from MNE (in ECG and EOG sections) are not interactive.

Default settings [DEFAULT]
--------------------------
- **do_for** (str) : which channels to process. Enter 1 or both values separated by coma. Default: *mag, grad*
- **subjects** (str) - all or list of subjects separated by coma - which subjects to process. If all chosen - all subjects in data set will be processed. Default: *all*

- Metrics to run:
    - **STD** (bool) : Standard deviation. Default: *True*
    - **PSD** (bool) : Power spectral density. Default: *True*
    - **PTP_manual** (bool) : Peak-to-peak amplitude manual. Default: *True*
    - **PTP_auto_mne** (bool) : Peak-to-peak amplitude automatic (MNE). Default: *True*
    - **ECG** (bool) : ECG: heart beat artifacts. Default: *True*
    - **EOG** (bool) : EOG: oculart artifacs. Default: *True*
    - **Head** (bool) : Head movement artifacts. Default: *True*
    - **Muscle** (bool) : High frequency (110-140Hz) noise strongy correlated with (but not limited to) Muscle artifacts. Default: *True*

- **plot_mne_butterfly** (bool) : Plot MNE butterfly plot. Default: *True*
- **plot_interactive_time_series** (bool) : Plot of the whole time series (each channel on top of others, separated by ch type: mags, grads). Will be done on the data resampled to 100Hz/sec. Raw data is shown, no filetring applied even if filer is set in the filering section. Benefit: it is interactive (you can see all or 1 or several channels, zoom in), which makes it more informative than built-in mne plot. Downside: This plot may signifcantly increase the time it takes to run the pipeline and the plot itself in html presentation might be slow due to large number of data points. Large size of html report. If you want to run it faster, set this to False. Default: *True*
- **plot_interactive_time_series_average** (bool) : Plot interactive time series average (average over all channels of each type: mags, grads). Plot will be done on the data resampled to 100Hz/sec. This plot may increase the time it takes to run the pipeline, but dosnt significantly increase the size of html report. Default: True
- **verbose_plots** (bool) : Show the plots when running the script (plotly and matplotlib). Default: True
- **data_directory** (str) : **Absolute** path to the data directory . Possible to also enter several data path separated by coma. Example: *user/path/to/my/data/ds000000, user/path/to/my/data/ds000001*
- **data_crop_tmin** (int) & **data_crop_tmax** (int) : Settings for data crop. If no cropping needed, leave blank. Unit: seconds. Default: *blank*

Filtering [Filtering]
---------------------
- **apply_filtering** (bool): if True, the data will be filtered. Default: *True*
- **downsample_to_hz** (int or float) - frequency to downsample to. Must be: 1. at least 5 times higher than h_freq to avoid misrepresentation. 2. Low value may lead to misrepresentation of chpi coils signal. They send signals in frequencies in higher than 100 hz. When downsampled this information may disappear. Recommended optimal value: 1000. Recommended minimum value: 500 Unit: Hz. Can be also set to False to avoid downsampling.
- **l_freq** (int or float) : lower frequency for bandpass filter. Unit: Hz. Default: *0*
- **h_freq** (int or float) : higher frequency for bandpass filter. Unit: Hz. Default: *140*. Reason: output of PSD can be used for filtering the data before muscle artifact detection. Musce artifacts are usually around 110-140 Hz, so this setting allows to see if there are extra frequencies which would need to be filtered out
- **method** (str) : method of filtering. Default: *iir*. Or turn off filtering completely by setting apply_filtering = False. Parameters in this case dont matter.

- **event_repeated** (str) : how to handle duplicates in events[:, 0]. Can be 'error' to raise an error, ‘drop’ to only retain the row occurring first in the events, or 'merge' to combine the coinciding events (=duplicates) into a new event (see Notes for details). Default: *merge*

------------------------
- **std_lvl** (int) : set like std_lvl = 1 or std_lvl = 3, etc. Defines how many std from the mean to use for the threshold. Default: *1*

- **noisy_channel_multiplier** (float or int) : Multiplier to define noisy channel, if std of this channel for this epoch is over** (the mean std of this channel for all epochs together*multipliar), then this channel is noisy. Higher value - less channels are marked as noisy. Default: *1.2*
- **flat_multiplier** (float or int) : Multiplier to define flat channel, if std of this channel for this epoch is under** (the mean std of this channel for all epochs together*multipliar), then this channel is flat. Default: *0.5*

- **freq_min** (int or float) : lower frequency for PSD calculation. Unit: seconds. Default: *0.5*
- **freq_max** (int or float) : higher frequency for PSD calculation. Unit: seconds. Default: *140*. Reason: output of PSD can be used for filtering the data before muscle artifact detection.

- **allow_percent_noisy_flat_epochs** (int) : defines how many percent of epochs can be noisy or flat. Over this number - epoch is marged as noisy/flat. Unit: percent. Default: *70*
- **std_lvl** (int) : set like std_lvl = 1 or std_lvl = 3, etc. Defines how many std from the mean to use for the threshold. Default: *1*
- **noisy_channel_multiplier** (float or int) : multiplier to define noisy channel, if std of this channel for this epoch is over** (the mean std of this channel for all epochs together*multipliar), then this channel is noisy. Default: *1.2*
- **flat_multiplier** (float or int) : multiplier to define flat channel, if std of this channel for this epoch is under** (the mean std of this channel for all epochs together*multipliar), then this channel is flat. Default: *0.5*

Heart beat artifacts [ECG]
--------------------------
- **drop_bad_ch** (bool) - if True - will drop the bad ECG channel from the data and attempt to reconstruct ECG data on base of magnetometers. If False - will not drop the bad ECG channel and will attempt to calculate ECG events on base of the bad ECG channel. Default: *True*
- **n_breaks_bursts_allowed_per_10min** (int) - number of breaks in ECG channel allowed per 10 minutes of recording. (This setting is for ECG channel only, not for any other channels Used to detect a noisy ECG channel). Default: *3*
- **allowed_range_of_peaks_stds** (float) - the allowed range of peaks in standard deviations. (This setting is for ECG channel only, not for any other channels Used to detect a noisy ECG channel). Defaault: *0.05* (experimentally chosen value). How the setting is used:

    - The peaks will be detected on the scaled data
    - The average std of all peaks has to be within this allowed range, If it is higher - the channel has too high deviation in peaks height and is counted as noisy

    - The channel data will be scaled from 0 to 1, so the setting is universal for all data sets.
    - The peaks will be detected on the scaled data
    - The average std of all peaks has to be within this allowed range, If it is higher - the channel has too high deviation in peaks height and is counted as noisy

    Unit: arbitrary (the data using this setting is always scaled between 0 and 1). Default: *0.05*

- **eog_epoch_tmin** (float) : time in seconds before the event. Unit: seconds. Default: *-0.2*
- **eog_epoch_tmax** (float) : time in seconds after the event. Unit: seconds. Default: *0.4*

- **min_length_good** (int or float) : The shortest allowed duration of "good data"** (in seconds) between adjacent muscle annotations; shorter segments will be incorporated into the surrounding annotations. Unit: seconds. Default: *0.2*
- **min_distance_between_different_muscle_events** (int or float) : minimum distance between different muscle events in seconds. If events happen closer to each other they will all be counted as one event and the time will be assigned as the first peak. Unit: seconds. Default: *1*  

Difference between last 2 settings: **min_length_good** - used to detect ALL muscle events, **min_distance_between_different_muscle_events** - used to detect evets with z-score higher than the threshold on base of ALL muscle events
